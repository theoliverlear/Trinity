# Trinity
## Intelligent multiband compression and tonal balance.

Trinity is a three-band equalizing compressor that blends transparent dynamics control
with spectral balance. Designed for musicians, engineers, and producers who want
both power and simplicity, it brings balance between lows, mids, and highs —
the core pillars of a pleasing, professional mix.

### ⭐️ What Trinity is...

* A 3-band dynamics processor that compresses and equalizes simultaneously.
* A tool to morph smoothly between tonal profiles, preserving energy and color.
* A zero-latency, phase-coherent processor built for real-time monitoring.
* A plugin that feels at home on the mix bus, drum bus, or master chain.

### 🧭 Core features

#### 🎚️ Three frequency bands

* Low: 0–250 Hz • Mid: 250–2000 Hz • High: 2 kHz–20 kHz
* Gentle crossover blending avoids harsh boundaries.

#### ⚙️ Independent compression per band

* Threshold, ratio, attack, release, knee, and makeup gain for each band.
* Optional solo and bypass for precise tuning.

#### 🌈 Morph Engine

* Interpolate between two “scenes” (A ↔ B) to evolve tone and dynamics over time.
* Automatable morph slider for creative movement.

#### 🔍 Visualization

* Responsive gain-reduction meters and spectral balance meter.
* Real-time input and output levels in decibels.

#### 🧩 Architected for clarity

* Linear-phase crossovers (optional), smooth parameter transitions, and low CPU load.
* Built using modern JUCE and C++20 best practices.

### ✅ Why you’ll love it

* Balance made intuitive — find a natural, musical equilibrium between bands.

* DSP Engine: JUCE DSP module, custom crossovers and morph system
* Plugin Formats: VST3 and Standalone
* Build System: CMake (cross-platform, reproducible)
* Tested Hosts: FL Studio, REAPER, Ableton Live

🚀 Quick start

1. Download Trinity (VST3 or Standalone).
2. Place .vst3 in your system’s plugin directory:
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
3. Open your DAW and scan for new plugins. 
4. Insert Trinity on a track or bus.
5. Adjust the low/mid/high bands and morph between Scene A ↔ B to shape your sound.
